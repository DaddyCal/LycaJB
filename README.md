# LycaJB
**LycaJB** is a project that aims to fill the gap in iOS 11.0 - 11.3.1 jailbreaks. While this jailbreak is specifically aimed at developers it could be turned into a public stable jailbreak which includes Cydia. Right now we had to make the hard decision to remove Cydia from LycaJB as it caused our test devices to bootloop. We are working hard to make this stable and ready for the public.
